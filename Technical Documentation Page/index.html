        <header>About Python</header>
        <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
        <p>Key Features of Python</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.</li>
          <li>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.</li> 
          <li>Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</li>
          <li>Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language.</li>
          <li>Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.</li>
          <li>Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.</li>
          <li>The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release." No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later are supported.</li>
        </ul>

        <header>The Python Tutorial</header>
        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>
        <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org/</a> , and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
        <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.</p>
        <p>This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Using_The_Python_interpreter">
        <header>Using The Python interpreter</header>
        <p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.8 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:</p>
        <code>python3.8</code>
        <p>On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the python3.8 command will be available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the "py" command.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python">
        <header id="aninformalintroductiontopython">An Informal Introduction to Python</header>       
        <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p>

        <p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.</p>
        <p>Some Examples:</p>
        <pre><code># this is the first comment
spam = 1 # and this is the second comment
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Numbers_in_Python">
        <header>Numbers in Python</header>
        <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>>>> 2 + 2 
4 
>>> 50 - 5*6 
20 
>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4 
5.0 <br>
>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point number
1.6
</code></pre>
          <p>The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the // operator; to calculate the remainder you can use % : </p>
          <pre><code>>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
5.666666666666667 
>>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part
5 
>>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
2 
>>> 5 * 3 + 2  # result * divisor + remainder
17 
</code></pre>
          <p>The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive prompt:</p>
          <pre><code>>>> width = 20 
>>> height = 5 * 9 
>>> width * height 
900
</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Strings_in_Python">
        <header>Strings in Python</header>
        <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result [2]. \ can be used to escape quotes:</p>
        <pre><code>>>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes
'spam eggs' 
>>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote... 
"doesn't" 
>>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead 
"doesn't" 
>>> '"Yes," they said.' 
'"Yes," they said.' 
>>> "\"Yes,\" they said."
'"Yes," they said.' 
>>> '"Isn\'t," they said.' 
'"Isn\'t," they said.'
</code></pre>
        <p>In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print() function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:</p>
        <pre><code>>>> '"Isn\'t," they said.' 
'"Isn\'t," they said.'
>>> print('"Isn\'t," they said.')
"Isn't," they said.
>>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline
>>> s  # without print(), \n is included in the output
'First line.\nSecond line.'
>>> print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line
First line.
Second line.
</code></pre>
        <p>Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:</p>
        <pre><code>>>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
'unununium'</code></pre>
